  startup_validation: `Hook: Did you know 90% of startups fail because of one simple mistake?

They focus on the product instead of understanding their customers.

Here's how to validate your idea in just 48 hours.

Step 1: Create a simple landing page with your value proposition.

Step 2: Drive traffic using targeted social media posts.

Step 3: Collect emails and feedback from interested users.

If you get 100+ signups, you've validated market demand!

Follow for more startup tips that actually work. Like and subscribe!`,

  productivity_tips: `Stop wasting 3 hours a day on these productivity killers.

Number 1: Checking email every 5 minutes destroys your focus.

Number 2: Multitasking makes you 40% less productive.

Number 3: Not time-blocking leads to reactive work patterns.

Here's what successful people do instead.

They batch email checking to 3 times per day.

They use deep work blocks for important tasks.

They plan their day the night before.

Try this for one week and watch your productivity soar.`,

  cooking_hack: `This 30-second cooking trick will change your life.

You've been cooking pasta wrong this whole time.

Instead of boiling water first, try this method.

Put pasta and cold water in the pan together.

Turn on high heat and stir occasionally.

The pasta releases starch gradually, creating perfect texture.

Plus you save time and energy costs.

Your pasta will taste better and be less sticky.

Try this tonight and thank me later!`,

  fitness_motivation: `Your gym routine is sabotaging your results.

Here's what trainers don't want you to know.

You don't need 2 hours at the gym every day.

Just 20 minutes of focused training beats hours of wandering.

Focus on compound movements: squats, deadlifts, push-ups.

Quality over quantity, always.

Progressive overload is the secret to growth.

Consistency beats perfection every single time.

Start small, stay consistent, see amazing results.`
